    <p>
        Constructive criticism is the receipt of feedback that may seem negative to me but is crucial for my improvement. It can be given in either direction of hierachy from leader to me as the subordinate or vice versa. An example may be getting a note of concern
        stating where I may have messed up on a project or wheremy work may have been below the standard andthat would pinpoint the issue I need to work on.
