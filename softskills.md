        Constructive criticism is the receipt of feedback that may seem negative but is not an attack to my persona rather than a crucial area for my improvement. It can be given in either direction of hierachy from leader to me as the subordinate or vice versa.
        An example may be getting a note of concern stating where I may have messed up on a project or wheremy work may have been below the standard andthat would pinpoint the issue I need to work on.
